# Introduction

This simple project shows how to mix Auto Layout and UIScrollView so that your
content automatically moves up when the keyboard appears.

# Key tip

As pointed out [here](http://natashatherobot.com/ios-autolayout-scrollview/),
"[t]he key to getting the constraints to work properly however, is adding an
Equal Width constraint between the main View and the ContentView."
